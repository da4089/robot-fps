Financial protocols simulator for Robot Framework.

Robot Framework is a system-testing framework, originally developed
primary by Pekka Klarck at Nokia Siemens Networks.  It provides a
simple language for writing tests, a range of libraries for different
test features, and a standard protocol for so-called remote servers.

This project implements a remote server that simulates both client and
server sides of various financial protocols, both order entry and
market data.  In combination with Robot Framework, tests can be
written to exercise applications using these protocols.
