Comparison with Rammbock
------------------------
Rammbock_ is the standard library for network protocol testing with
Robot Framework.

*Robot NPS* has the following key differences:

* *Robot NPS* is aimed at allowing tests to be written by people
  familiar with the protocol and with Robot Framework, but not
  necessarily programmers or network experts.
* Protocols in *Robot NPS* are defined in Python code, by developers.
  Rammbock protocols are defined in the test cases or keywords using
  Robot syntax.
